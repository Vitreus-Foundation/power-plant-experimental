//! # Vitreus DEX pallet
//!
//! A native AMM DEX pallet for the Vitreus blockchain. Scaffolded to mirror the
//! structure of `pallet-energy-broker`. Pallet index: 43. PalletId: `vtrs/dex`.
//!
//! Other pallets in the same runtime can create pools and provision liquidity
//! without dispatching extrinsics via the [`PoolManager`] trait (implemented
//! for [`Pallet`]), which wraps the origin-free `do_create_pool`,
//! `do_add_liquidity_for` and `do_lock_liquidity_for` helpers.
//!
//! # Part 3 integration notes (runtime wiring)
//!
//! When wiring this pallet into `runtime/vitreus/src/lib.rs`:
//!
//! 1. **Pallet index 43** — confirmed free between `DynamicEnergy = 42` and
//!    `Proxy = 44`. Use `VitreusDex: pallet_vitreus_dex = 43`.
//!
//! 2. **Energy fee routing** — `pallet_energy_fee` is the runtime's
//!    `OnChargeTransaction`. Add `RuntimeCall::VitreusDex(..)` to the
//!    `CallFee::Regular(Self::custom_fee())` match in
//!    `runtime/vitreus/src/lib.rs` (around the `CustomFee` impl) or leave
//!    it to the default `weight_fee` branch — decide per governance.
//!
//! 3. **`DefaultSolverBondAmount`** — do NOT use the mock value of
//!    `1_000_000_000_000` in production. VTRS has 18 decimals; use
//!    `1_000 * UNITS` (= 10^21) or the post-governance agreed value.
//!
//! 4. **Same-block bid races** — Vitreus runs BABE with rotational block
//!    authorship, and `pallet_energy_fee::pay_priority_fee` is a no-op so
//!    tips can't influence inclusion. Same-block overbidding is
//!    non-deterministic in ordering but economically sound: the current
//!    BABE author's mempool view decides which valid bid lands first;
//!    losers retry next block. No commit-reveal needed.
