//! # pallet-launch-treasury
//!
//! Validator-backed treasuries for launchpad tokens (`pallets/LAUNCH_TREASURY_SPEC.md`).
//!
//! A fixed slice of every trade in a launch token — the pool's `treasury_bps`
//! (DEX D9) and the curve's `treasury_share_bps` (launchpad L1) — is pushed
//! to one pallet-owned account, the **vault**. The vault bonds everything it
//! holds as a single cooperator of `energy-generation` and re-cooperates in
//! the same extrinsic as every change to its bond, so bonded and cooperated
//! stake never drift apart (spec §6.2). Each launch's claim on the pooled
//! stake is a share balance; the LNRG the stake earns is attributed to
//! shares with a Synthetix-style accumulator whose only participants are
//! launches, which this pallet alone can change (§2.3). `compound` sells a
//! launch's LNRG to the energy broker for VTRS, buys the launch token on its
//! own venue in impact-capped slices and burns it (§6.4). A launch whose
//! venue has been quiet for `dormancy_blocks` is retired permissionlessly:
//! its shares unbond and, seven days later, the principal is burned into the
//! venue the same way (§2.4).
//!
//! No extrinsic here moves VTRS or LNRG to a caller-chosen account. The only
//! outbound transfers are the broker sale, the venue buy, a bounded keeper
//! bounty to the caller of `compound`, and a sub-ED dust sweep to the
//! protocol recipient when a retired treasury closes (I-T3). Governance can
//! steer where the stake sits and what the operational bounds are; it has no
//! withdraw, redirect or unbond path.
//!
//! This pallet has no `on_initialize`. `Hooks` implements `try_state` and
//! `integrity_test` only (§6.2, option (a)).
